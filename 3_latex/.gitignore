# Build directory - ignore generated contents but allow the directory and
# specific placeholder file to be tracked. Use 'build/*' so we can re-include
# an explicit file inside the directory (negation below).
build/*

# Output directory - ignore generated contents (PDFs) but allow the
# placeholder file to be tracked via the negation rule below.
output/*

# Keep placeholder files tracked so the folders exist in git even though
# their contents (logs, generated PDFs) are ignored. The negation allows
# the specific .gitkeep files to be committed while keeping build/ and
# output/ contents ignored.
!build/.gitkeep
!output/.gitkeep

# Ignore all PDFs by default but allow PDFs kept in the templates folder
# This keeps built PDFs out of git, while letting template example PDFs be
# committed (for review or examples). Patterns are rooted at this folder.
