LINKEDIN BOOLEAN SEARCH QUERIES
=============================================================================
Use these query templates to find relevant job postings on LinkedIn.

HOW TO USE:
1. Copy a query template below
2. Customize it with your target keywords, skills, and job titles
3. Paste into LinkedIn Jobs search or set up as a Job Alert
4. Save working queries here for reuse

TIPS:
- LinkedIn requires UPPERCASE operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- Use quotes for exact phrases: "Software Engineer"
- Keep queries under ~500 characters to avoid truncation
- Combine layers with AND to narrow results
- Use NOT to exclude irrelevant results

SAVING ALERTS:
- In LinkedIn, save searches as "Job Alerts" for email notifications
- Create multiple alerts for different focus areas
