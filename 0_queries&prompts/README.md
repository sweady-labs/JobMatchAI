# query boolean logoc linkedIN

 - linkedin is not able to digest very long boolean query logic
 - thats why we create different query layers for each search in the search bar e.g
     → Domain + Role
     → Role + Tech
     → Domain + Role + Tech
 - examples in the following .md files
 - its also possible oc to combine queries individual and create new job reminder mails via linkedIN
