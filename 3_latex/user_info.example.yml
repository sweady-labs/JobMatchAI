# USER INFORMATION TEMPLATE
# =============================================================================
# This file contains personal data used to auto-fill LaTeX templates.
# 
# HOW TO USE:
# 1. Copy this file to 'user_info.yml' in the same directory
# 2. Replace all placeholder values with your real information
# 3. Add your profile picture to 3_latex/src/figures/ (optional)
# 4. Add your signature image to 3_latex/src/figures/ (optional)
#
# IMPORTANT: 
# - The 'user_info.yml' file is listed in .gitignore and won't be committed
# - Never commit your real personal data to a public repository
# - The 'id' field is used to select which profile to use in the workflow
#
# PLACEHOLDERS IN LATEX TEMPLATES:
# The parser (parse_md_to_tex.py) replaces these placeholders:
#   {{YOUR_NAME}}      -> full_name
#   {{YOUR_EMAIL}}     -> email  
#   {{YOUR_PHONE}}     -> phone
#   {{YOUR_LINKEDIN}}  -> linkedin_url
#   {{YOUR_LOCATION}}  -> location
#   ... and more (see parse_md_to_tex.py for full list)
# =============================================================================

# You can define multiple profiles (e.g., for different family members or clients)
# The n8n workflow selects which profile to use based on the 'id' field
