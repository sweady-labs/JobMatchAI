=============================================================================
EXAMPLE AI-GENERATED APPLICATION LETTER
=============================================================================
This is an example of what the n8n workflow + GPT produces.

The letter follows a specific format that the LaTeX parser understands:
- YAML frontmatter (fileName, language)
- HTML comment labels (<!-- PARAGRAPH_X_NAME -->)
- \lettercontent{} blocks containing the actual text

HOW THE WORKFLOW PRODUCES THIS:
1. n8n reads your job posting from 0_inbox-jobs/
2. n8n reads your competence profile from 1_profile/
3. The GPT prompt combines both and generates this structured letter
4. n8n saves the output to 2_applications-mds/

AFTER GENERATION:
1. Review and edit the content if needed
2. Run: make md2pdf (converts to LaTeX and compiles PDF)
3. Find your PDF in 3_latex/output/

CUSTOMIZATION:
- You can edit this file before PDF generation
- The section labels must remain intact for parsing
- The \lettercontent{} blocks map to LaTeX template placeholders
